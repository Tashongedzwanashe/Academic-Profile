        <p>
          Dirk Brockmann is director of the Center Synergy of Systems (SynoSys)
          at TU Dresden (Dresden University of Technology) and professor for
          Biology of Complex Systems in the Departments of Biology and Physics
          there. He studied physics and mathematics at the University of
          GÃ¶ttingen, Germany where he received his PhD in theoretical physics.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before becoming founding director of SynoSys he was professor at the
          Departments of Biology and Physics at Humboldt University of Berlin
          and led a research team at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin,
          Germany's national public health institute. Between 2008 and 2013 he
          was professor at the Department of Applied Mathematics at Northwestern
          University and faculty member of the Northwestern's Institute on
          Complex Systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dirk has worked on various topics, ranging from computational
          neuroscience and anomalous diffusion in biological and physical
          systems to infectious disease dynamics, human mobility, network theory
          and citizen science.
        </p>

        <p>
          He pioneered the analysis of mass data obtained in natural experiments
          and understanding human behavior based on data collected by digital
          devices. During the COVID-19 pandemic he launched the German Data
          Donation Project, in which more than 500,000 donors provided data
          collected on their smart-watches and wearable devices on a daily basis
          for more than 2,5 years, the largest dataset of this kind in public
          hands worldwide.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dirk believes in the value of anti-disciplinary science, the
          intentional breach of traditional scientific boundaries and is
          particularly interested in bridging the gap between biological and
          social sciences and the philosophy of complexity science. He coined
          the phrase "Get lost in Science!" to stress the importance of
          explorative research as opposed to hypothesis driven research, using a
          compass instead of a map for navigating the unknown.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2017 Dirk launched the Complexity Explorables, a collection of
          web-based interactive models of famous and less famous complex systems
          to illustrate the beauty of complex dynamical phenomena and teach
          young students about these systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, Dirk is most interested in the design of citizen science
          projects, in which the general public can participate in scientific
          endeavours via digital tools and technologies. He is also interested
          in the emergence of cooperation, mutualism and fungi.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dirk's work has been covered extensively by the media and the press,
          e.g. the New York Times, the Washington Post, the BBC, various TV
          shows in the United States, Europe and Germany. During the pandemic he
          was a regular expert guest in numerous TV talk shows and the main
          German TV news shows.
